# CMS-Open-Payments-Data-Analysis

This is my first individual foray into the field of data science.
The project walks through my process from data retrieval and wrangling to the creation of a working machine learning model for classifying by size the payments made by a leading pharmaceutical company.
While it is limited in scope not in small part due to personal computer performance and a need for deeper subject knowledge,
the process can be repeated for any leading pharmaceutical company mentioned the dataset.
